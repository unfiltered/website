Netty Plans
-----------

Unfiltered's interfaces to Netty reflect the lower-level nature of
Netty as compared to Servlet Filters. This gives greater flexibility
and power to the application, necessarily requiring greater
responsibility and attention to detail by the programmer. If you're
up for the challenge or just want to play with something new, then
give it a whirl.
