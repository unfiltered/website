Directives and Validation
-------------------------

Pattern matching is an easy and reliable way to handle requests that
conform to expected criteria, but what about the requests that don't?
Typically, they fall through to a 404 handler. While this behavior is
logical enough from the perspective of a service's programming,
clients of the service might reasonably assume that they've supplied
the wrong path instead of, as in a previous example,
@ref:[an invalid parameter][extractors].

[extractors]: ../06/b.md#routing-by-parameter

With enough fallback cases and nested match expressions, you could
program whatever logic you want â€” including descriptive error
handling. But that approach sacrifices the simplicity and readability
that made pattern matching attractive in the first place.

**Fortunately, there is another way.** With directives you can express
request criteria concisely, and scrupulously handle errors too.
