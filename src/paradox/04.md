Project Setup
-------------

### Modules and Artifacts

Unfiltered's core, binding, server, and other modules are published
with references to their underlying dependencies, so that applications
need only explicitly depend on Unfiltered and other top-level
dependencies. Keep in mind that server modules and binding modules are
not generally co-dependent, so that if you are using for example
unfiltered-jetty, you will also need to specify unfiltered-filter.

Each module is [cross-built][sbt] against several versions of Scala
and published to the [maven central][maven central] repository with the
organization-id "ws.unfiltered". The modules have the Scala version
they are built against appended. For Scala 3+, the full artifact
names are as follows:

* unfiltered_3
* unfiltered-filter_3
* unfiltered-filter-async_3
* unfiltered-netty_3
* unfiltered-netty-websockets_3
* unfiltered-jetty_3
* unfiltered-netty-server_3
* unfiltered-uploads_3
* unfiltered-util_3
* unfiltered-specs2_3
* unfiltered-scalatest_3
* unfiltered-json4s_3

### Build Tools

#### Configuring sbt projects

When using sbt with **binary dependencies** it's best to have the
Scala version [automatically appended][sbt] so it will always match
your project's. In an sbt project:

@@@vars
```scala
libraryDependencies += "ws.unfiltered" %% "unfiltered-filter" % "$version$"
```
@@@


#### Maven

For Maven, specify the full artifact name:

@@@vars
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>ws.unfiltered</groupId>
  <artifactId>unfiltered-filter_3</artifactId>
  <version>$version$</version>
</dependency>
```
@@@

To use source dependencies with Maven, your best bet is to check out
the project as a submodule.

### Template Projects

For a new project the easiest the easiest option to apply a
[giter8][g8] template for the Unfiltered backend of your choice.

* [**unfiltered/unfiltered.g8**](https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered.g8) for embedded Jetty
* [**unfiltered/unfiltered-scalate.g8**](https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered-scalate.g8) for Scalate template evaluation
* [**unfiltered/unfiltered-war.g8**](https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered-war.g8) for a servlet container
* [**unfiltered/unfiltered-netty.g8**](https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered-netty.g8) for Netty
* [**unfiltered/unfiltered-slick.g8**](https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered-slick.g8) using [Slick][slick] for database interaction

[slick]: https://scala-slick.org/

So for example:

```sh
g8 unfiltered/unfiltered-netty --name=justplayin
cd justplayin
sbt # *or whatever your command is
> run
```
