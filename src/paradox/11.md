Jetty Extras
------------

### Serving Resources from a relative path

Sometimes you may want to serve resources from a relative path, for example a sibling directory located at `../client`. But paths containing `..` are considered aliased and Jetty disallows these by default,
as described in this [policy](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/serving-aliased-files.html).

If you've evaluated the security risks described in the link above and wish to enable aliases in paths, you can do so
with `allowAliases(true)`, eg:

@@snip [ ](../main/scala/11.scala) { #example1 }

### Enabling Request Logs

Jetty can be configured to log all requests in Common or Extended formats with `requestLogging`. This is a global, not per-context,
[setting](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-jetty-request-logs.html).
At minimum you need to specify where to log to:

@@snip [ ](../main/scala/11.scala) { #example2 }
