Plans and Intents
-----------------

Unfiltered conditionally handles incoming requests using partial
functions. From the application's perspective, requests are
mapped to code paths by pattern matching. The library uses
a particular vocabulary to refer to the agents of this process
without ambiguity.

* An *intent* is a partial function for matching requests.
* A *plan* binds an intent to a particular server interface.

For example, the @extref[`unfiltered.filter.Plan`](unidoc:unfiltered/filter/Plan) trait extends the
`jakarta.servlet.Filter` interface. It declares an abstract `intent`
method for clients to define the intent partial function.

### Making Plans of Intents

Looking back at the example on the previous page, you might wonder
where the plan ends and the intent begins.

@@snip [ ](../main/scala/02.scala) { #example1 }

In this case a plan is constructed directly from an anonymous partial
functionâ€”that function is the intent. We can define the same plan in
more explicit parts, as is usually necessary in a larger application.

@@snip [ ](../main/scala/02.scala) { #example2 }

Since this kind of plan is an implementation of the servlet filter
interface, we can pass it directly to a servlet container.

@@snip [ ](../main/scala/02.scala) { #example3 }

### Passing on That

Since an intent is a partial function, it may be undefined for a
request. In this case the request may be handled by some other intent
or it could produce a 404 error from the server.

Unfiltered also supports an explicit mechanism to specify that a
matched request should not be handled by an intent: the `Pass` object.

@@snip [ ](../main/scala/02.scala) { #example4 }

This intent avoids handling anything under `/admin` by matching that
condition and passing on it. There are other ways to achieve the same
ends, but an explicit `Pass` is often the most straightforward.

Keep in mind that Scala's partial functions are unaware of
Unfiltered's `Pass` mechanism, so the intent above is in fact
*defined* for the excluded paths. But when attached to a plan,
requests that evaluate to `Pass` are treated the same as those that
are undefined.

### Chaining Intents

When you want to combine intents within a single plan, use `onPass`:

@@snip [ ](../main/scala/02.scala) { #example5 }

The `onPass` method is defined implicitly for `PartialFunction` with
the import of the `unfiltered.response._` package. It works like
`orElse` but is aware of the `Pass` object and it's optimized to avoid
unnecessary reevaluation of pattern guards.
